# Facial Recognition Attendance System
This project detects faces in a webcam feed, matches them against known faces, and marks attendance in an Excel sheet.

## How to use it
1. Prepare a directory named `known_faces` containing images of known faces.
2. Each image should be named after the corresponding student ID.
3. Run `python3 test-image.py` to find faces in the test image, or run `python3 test-video.py` to find faces from webcam.
4. Press 'q' to exit the program.
